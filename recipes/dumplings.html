        <li>1/2 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1 cup cabbage, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 green onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>

        <li>Place a small spoonful of the filling in the center of each dumpling wrapper.</li>
        <li>Wet the edges of the wrapper with water, fold it in half, and press the edges to seal, creating a pleated edge if desired.</li>
