        <li>Add the star anise, cinnamon stick, and cloves to the pot. Reduce the heat and let the broth simmer for 2-3 hours for maximum flavor.</li>
        <li>Once the broth is ready, strain it to remove the solids and season with fish sauce, salt, and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, cook the rice noodles according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>To serve, place a portion of noodles in a bowl, top with thin slices of raw beef sirloin, and ladle the hot broth over the top. The heat from the broth will cook the beef.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, and chili slices as desired. Enjoy your homemade beef pho!</li>
